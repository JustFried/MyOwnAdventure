				<h1>You suddenly can't see</h1>

				<p>blindfolded, you hear the sounds of conversations around your ear, telling you it's alright. You come to an understanding that they meant no harm, that these creatures just don't want you to see much of their home. They guide you with their voices to a stump which you sat down on being told to. You can hear the sound of fire crackling and music playing. As all this goes on they start feeding you. Fruits so sweet with a taste you never had before, drinks were cold and sweet like honey very refreshing. It was a celebration, in this dark forest?
